A short guide how to collect your data and create your post card.
<!--more-->

The herein presented guide is a merged summary of our experiences and the one described
in the original [Dear Data book](http://www.dear-data.com).

We added a few tipps that we become aware of while trying to initiate our own post card journey.

### The Question

When we started to think about possible questions it turned out to be more complicated than expected
to think of a reasonable one. 

In order to get started take the main question and think of additional information you would be interested in.

>An example: "How much time do I spend doing sports?" leading to further questions like:
"What time do I do sports?", "With whom do I do sports?", "Which kind of sports?", "How did I feel after sports?"

All this details could turn into a specific shape in your drawing. Track as many information as you would like to. There is no limit.

### Gathering Data
Create a list of all information you want to track on a piece of paper or phone at the beginning of the week. 

Try to update your lists immediately and in real-time. In case your information are collected on different media try to collect them at the end of the day. 

Extend your lists on the fly as you come across another detail you would like to track. At the best: right at the first day.


### Discover your Data

After seven days of data collecting sit down and discover your data. Try to identify groups and repetitive patterns.

It might be helpful to start grouping similar items by using different colors or shapes. Count your attributes and get an overview how often a specific event occured.

Think about the general structure or architecture of the card. Do you want to summarise your data chronologically or might be a location-specific point of view more suitable or even per importance.

After a while you'll find the story of your data. Do not worry if you start drawing over and over again. Browse the blog or dear data home page for inspiration.


### Draw Your Post Card

At the end draw the final story of the front-page of the post card. 

On the backside add a legend introducing all the colors and shapes of your
story. Group categories

Both sides together deliver your personal story of the previous week. Well done!
