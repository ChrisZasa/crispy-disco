**Dear Data** is a collection post cards visualizing daily routines drawn by Georiga Lupi and Stefanie Posavec [Link](http://www.dear-data.com). 

Each week both crafted and sent each other post card crossing the ocean to stay in contact. Each card shows the data of a distinct topic based on their own habbits and daily life.
