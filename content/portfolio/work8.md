Things that are in our mind that we would like to implement before the release of this project.
<!--more-->


> So far only in bullett points some topics for our chat tomorrow :).

### Project-related items

    * Which topic do we start with?
    * Do we miss important information?
    * General schedule of the project (monthly, dates of topic announcement...)
    * copyright issues on webpages and of Dear Data

  Topics I liked as an easy starter:

    * Week#1: 'Whats the time?' - same kick off as the actual project
    * Week#3: 'Thank you so much' - things that we easily overlook in daily routine


### Technical stuff
  
    * Design of the website (useful, better options)
    * how can we both smoothly work on the project? Github project on a separate Github accound?
    * how to implement the submission process
    * do we keep netlify or move to github pages
    * www.formspree.io for contacting us?
  

### Social media / general accounts

Shall we create project-related accounts to spread the news?
  
    * email address on Rladies domain, e.g., deardata@rladies.org?
    * Instagram account
    * Twitter account
    * formspree.io account (mail via webpage)
    * google analytics
  
### Uncategorized items

Well, nothing so far ...
